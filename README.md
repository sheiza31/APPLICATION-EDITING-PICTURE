# MATLAB Photo Editing Application

This repository contains a **simple photo editing application developed in MATLAB** as part of an academic project. The program demonstrates basic image processing operations and provides a simple user interface for editing images.

## 🧠 Overview

This application is built using **MATLAB** and leverages fundamental image processing techniques. It allows users to load an image and perform basic editing tasks such as brightness/contrast adjustments and simple transformations. This project is suitable for learning and experimenting with digital image processing concepts and the MATLAB environment.

## 🚀 Features

- Load and view images in common formats (e.g., JPG, PNG)
- Adjust brightness and contrast of images
- Apply simple image enhancements
- Save edited images  
(*Features may vary based on implementation in `Aplikasi_Editfoto.m`*)
